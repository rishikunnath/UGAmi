## Project Information

Team Members: Marion Manalo, Sebastian Wu, Rishi Kunnath

Tier Level: Intermediate

### Project Description

This mobile app provides a platform for college students who are looking to find friends on campus based on their user profiles.






## Friday 

#### Goals:

- [ ] Figure out and decide on what challenge/project to do
- [ ] Decide on what tech stack to use
- [ ] Make diagram of mobile app’s UI

#### Progress:

- Finished rough-diagramming the app UI 
- Brainstormed app functions


#### Challenges:

Challenge 1: Coming up with an idea that is more than just a ChatGPT wrapper
   - Solution (if found): Decided on making an original mobile app instead of a web app that would implement OpenAI’s API.

Challenge 2: Figuring out what app to make based on our pre-existing knowledge
   - Solution (if found): We all communicated what experience we had with various languages and frameworks.


#### Learning:

- Design Planning
- Team Communication



#### AI Usage (if any): None

- Tool used: N/A
- Purpose: N/A
- How it contributed to learning: N/A






## Saturday 

#### Goals:

- [ ] Complete Firebase relationship with the frontend
- [ ] Make dummy accounts to help with functionality testing
- [ ] Implement functionality for users to upload an image as their - profile picture
- [ ] Create a “ping” button that allows the user to send a message to another user’s profile
- [ ] Implement functionality that allows users to edit their own profiles

#### Progress:

- Login page layout and functionality developed successfully
- Successfully implemented profile picture upload functionality
- Successfully implemented user capability to edit their profile
- Successfully completed Firebase relationship with frontend


#### Challenges:

Challenge 1: The button to go back to the last visited page ends up sending the user all the way back to the login page and therefore requiring them to log back in each time, however, the user’s credentials are still filled out on the login page.  This presents not only an inconvenience to the user, but also an indication of poor quality and security.
   - Solution (if found): Figured out how to get rid of the back button – no longer needed.

Challenge 2: There were problems with aligning a user’s name on their card to be positioned around the bottom left corner of the card design; attempts at accomplishing this resulted in the name being distorted or outside of the card design.
   - Solution (if found): Changed background color of the homepage to black, making the initial alignment mistake into an intentional artistic decision.



#### Learning:

- Basics of Swift and SwiftUI
- VStack (Vertical Stack)
- HStack (Horizontal Stack)
- Installing dependencies through Xcode
- Firebase data retrieval


#### AI Usage (if any):

- Tool used: ChatGPT
- Purpose: Debugging and learning
- How it contributed to learning:
    - Helped with learning the structure of SwiftUI and relating it to technology that we have previous knowledge and experience with such as React and Node.js.






## Sunday

#### Goals:

- [ ] Database integration for the homepage
- [ ] Implement human interaction, such as swiping left or right on the user profile that is currently being displayed to the user
- [ ] Add user profile pictures to database (overlooked on Saturday)
- [ ] Conduct a full test of the app
- [ ] Push final version of app to GitHub

#### Progress:

- Successfully implemented swiping functionality
- Partial test of the app was conducted


#### Challenges:

Challenge 1: Implementing a content recommendation algorithm; requires machine learning, which none of us have had in-depth experience with.
   - Solution (if found): N/A

Challenge 2: Information queuing algorithm for the main feed; general idea in mind, but not enough time to implement.
   - Solution (if found): N/A


#### Learning:

- Git/GitHub
    - Tracking/staging files
    - Committing
    - Pushing to remote GitHub repository


#### AI Usage (if any): None
